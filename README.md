Project Title: Tac-Tic
Project Page: 

We have two java files, named TacTicMain and TacTicComp. TacTicMain is the main java document and TacTicComp is the class that is used in the main file. In order to run the program , we recommend it to be compiled in an IDE such as Powershell or Command Prompt. 

Once the two files have been compiled, the grid will pop up. You will have the option of playing against the computer(single player) or playing with another person(multi player). 

When playing with the computer, the computer will play as the opponent. When playing multi player , the person you are with physically will play as the opponent. 

The aim of the game is to play three of your tokens in a line consecutively. You should also try your best to block your opponent from winning.
